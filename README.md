# Photoshop Fight

Photoshop Fight is an idea founded through watching online Photoshop battles on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RjMiWVWJmE). It was created to simplify the process of creating, competing, and viewing a live Photoshop battle.
